# Datspec

Protocols and specs for the Datsys architecture.

In a sense this _is_ the architecture.
The rest of the Dat\* projects are really just implementations.


## Overview

This project provides a namespace `src/dat/protocols.cljc` of protocols
which should be satisfied by system components (a la Stuart Sierra) making up an implementation of
the abstract Datsys architecture.
This modular design leaves a wide birth of flexibility for customization.


## TODO

More detailed documentation is coming soon.
